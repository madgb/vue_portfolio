# Woobin Huh's Portfolio

A portfolio site showcasing projects and skills as a Senior Frontend Developer, built with Vue 3, Vuex, Tailwind CSS, and Vite.

## Tech Stack

This project uses the following core technologies:

### 1. Vue 3
Vue 3 is the main framework used to structure and develop this portfolio. It allows for a component-based, reactive approach to building the UI, making the site highly modular and maintainable.

### 2. Vuex
Vuex is used for centralized state management across the application. This allows us to manage global data (like project information) consistently and reliably, especially when handling complex state dependencies throughout the app.

### 3. Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS offers a utility-first approach to styling, enabling rapid and responsive UI development without custom CSS. This keeps styling consistent across components and makes maintenance easier.

### 4. Vite
Vite is used as the build tool for this project, providing a fast development environment with hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized builds. Vite's performance and simplicity make it an ideal choice for Vue 3 projects.

### 5. Vue Router
Vue Router is used to handle navigation between pages (e.g., Home, Projects, Project Details, Tech Stack). It enables a seamless single-page application (SPA) experience with dynamic content loading, improving user experience.

### 6. GitHub Pages
The project is deployed on GitHub Pages, with the build output configured to the `/docs` folder. GitHub Pages provides a fast, free, and reliable hosting solution for static sites, making it easy to share this portfolio online.
